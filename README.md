# MERN-STACK

The main aim of this project is to demonstrate how to integrate our knowledge of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, to create a functional web application.
The project is a fullstack application that enables internet service providers to manage their customers. 
It has two main sections: customer registration and a view of all the customers.

The internet service provider can view all the users, update their details or delete customers as needed.

[Here](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/build-mern-stack-application-to-manage-isp/) is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to build the management system.
